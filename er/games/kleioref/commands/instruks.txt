Hei Jørn,
please find attached the final version of "doc.txt" now.


As soon as you have converted that into a set of interrelated pages,
I'll start filling them up with descriptions; so the conversion does not
haev to be repeated. This is another way of saying, that you may find it
easier, ultimately, if you convert some of the very rare constructs in
the file by hand.


Unfortunately I had to introduce one more construct.


The reasoning is the following. In the case of a few commands (notably
"Item", which accounts for almost exactly 50 % of the whole file) a
parameter of the command decides which directives may follow.


I have described this situation as follows:


<command>
... parameter for this command ...
<contextlist>
<contextdescription> ... </contextdescription>


<context>
<name>xxxx</name>
<directivelist>
...
</directivelist>
</context>


... more <context> </context> tags.
</contextlist>
</command>


The idea behind this construction is as follows:


In the window at the left side of the screen, the parameters for the
command are displayed. If the command contains also a <context> tag,
there shoudl also appear a (rather prominent) button "directives".


If this is pressed, at the top of the lefthand window the content of
<contextdescription> appears, followed by the names of all contexts.


If the name of a context is clicked, the left hand window contains a
list of the directives for that context.


If the name of a directive is clicked, the names of the parameters for
thsi directive appear.


Well ... and than there is one special case; if you look for the tag
<note> you'll see a descripytion of it. (That occurs only once.)


Thanks a lot in advance,
Manfred
